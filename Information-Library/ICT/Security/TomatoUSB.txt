=== Introduction ===
TomatoUSB is an alternative Linux-based firmware for powering Broadcom-based ethernet routers. It is a modification of the famous Tomato firmware, 
with additional built-in support for USB port, wireless-N mode support, support for several newer router models, and various enhancements.

Through this memo, we will be using Asus RT-N12 D1 -model router so all information in this memo has been tested with that specific router model.

=== Installation ===
Set your wired network to same ip address space ie. change your wireless adapter settings to have manual ip address and subnet:
Ip: 192.168.1.2
Subnet: 255.255.255.0

[intalling firmware]

=== Post-Installation ===
Access your router via web interface (192.169.1.1), go to Administration -> Configuration -> Restore Default Configuration. Select "Erase all data NVRAM 
memory (thorough)" and click OK.

If you manage to mess around with the web interface and make it unaccessable, you should take a backup of NVRAM settings. With web interface, go to:
Administration -> Configuration -> Backup Configuration, choose filename and click Backup. Good practice is to transfer this file to routers persistent
data directory (/jffs) via ssh. So login with ssh and use secure copy to get file from your computer to router.
Example: scp username@computer:/remote_dir/filename /jffs

=== SSH Access ===
SSH access with default password "admin". SSH access username is allways root!
Usage: ssh root@192.168.1.1

=== Directory structure ===
Basic linux directory structure with couple of differences:
/jffs - Store any kind of persistent data. If you write something to standard filesystem (eg: /root), the changes will not persist after a router reboot.

=== Installing Package Manager ===
First obtain Optware for TomatoUSB, this comes with a package manager called ipkg.

=== Terminology ===
JFFS    - Journaling Flash File System, log-structured file system for use on NOR flash memory devices on the Linux operating system
Optware - Distribution of packages that are suitable for installation within small embedded systems, just like the routers on which TomatoUSB runs. 
          Optware uses the ipkg package manager. It is equivalent to the package manager tools usually available on desktop Linux systems such as apt, 
		  yum or yast. Optware packages are distributed as .ipk files (so standard .deb or .rpm files cannot be used).
		  

=== Notes ===
* Basic -> Static DHCP/ARP/IPT -> Options -> Ignore DHCP requests from unknow devices
